Here’s a structured roadmap for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that takes you from fundamentals to advanced concepts, and finally projects where you can apply your learning.

1. Fundamentals

Cloud Basics

What is cloud computing? IaaS, PaaS, SaaS

GCP architecture (regions, zones, projects)

Identity & Access Management (IAM)

Core Services

Compute: Compute Engine (VMs), App Engine (PaaS), Cloud Functions (serverless)

Storage: Cloud Storage, Persistent Disks, Filestore

Networking: VPC, subnets, firewalls, Cloud DNS, Load Balancing

Databases: Cloud SQL, Firestore, Bigtable, Spanner

Basic Tools

Cloud Console

Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI)

Billing and cost management

2. Intermediate

Compute & Containerization

Kubernetes Engine (GKE) basics

Deploying containers with Cloud Run

Data & Analytics

BigQuery (data warehouse, SQL analytics)

Dataflow (ETL/ELT pipelines)

Pub/Sub (event-driven messaging)

Storage & Caching

Cloud Memorystore (Redis, Memcached)

Data lifecycle management in Cloud Storage

Networking Advanced

Shared VPC, Interconnect, VPN

Load balancing types (HTTP(S), TCP/UDP, SSL proxy)

Security

Service accounts & roles

Key Management System (KMS)

Cloud Armor (DDoS protection)

3. Advanced

DevOps & CI/CD

Cloud Build

Artifact Registry

Continuous Deployment pipelines

AI/ML

Vertex AI for ML lifecycle

AI APIs (Vision, Speech, NLP, Translation)

Serverless & Event-driven Architectures

Cloud Functions + Pub/Sub integration

Eventarc

Hybrid & Multi-cloud

Anthos (multi-cloud Kubernetes)

Hybrid connectivity with on-premise

Cost Optimization & Monitoring

Cloud Monitoring & Logging

Budgets & Quotas

FinOps strategies

Compliance & Governance

Resource hierarchy

Organization policies

Security Command Center

4. Projects (Hands-On)

Here are some projects from beginner to advanced:

Beginner

Deploy a static website on GCP using Cloud Storage + Cloud CDN.

Set up a simple VM instance with a web server (Compute Engine).

Build a serverless API using Cloud Functions + Firestore.

Intermediate

Deploy a containerized application on Cloud Run.

Create a data pipeline: Ingest data with Pub/Sub → Transform with Dataflow → Store in BigQuery.

Build a chat application using Firebase + GCP services.

Advanced

Implement CI/CD pipeline with Cloud Build + GKE.

Real-time analytics dashboard: Streaming data with Pub/Sub → BigQuery → Looker Studio.

Machine Learning: Train a custom ML model with Vertex AI and deploy an endpoint.

Hybrid Cloud: Deploy a microservices app spanning GCP + On-prem using Anthos.
