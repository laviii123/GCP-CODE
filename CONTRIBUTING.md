Only meaningful, non-spammy PRs will be counted. Small typo fixes, documentation improvements, bug fixes, tests, and new features are welcome.

Your PR must be open-source friendly and follow this repo’s coding standards.

If your PR is accepted, we’ll add the hacktoberfest-accepted label (or merge it) — that’s what Hacktoberfest looks for.
